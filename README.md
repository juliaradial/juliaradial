## My name is Yulia Nikitina


The experience of working in various fields allowed me to identify and master exactly the area in which I can bring maximum benefit - analytics.
The ability to see the action behind each figure came from accounting.
The ability to find dependencies, anomalies, insights came from data analysis.
The ability to have clear and effective communication came from sales.

Thanks to the Yandex advanced training course, I refreshed my knowledge of statistics and economics. In addition, I learned Python, SQL and visualization tools well.
I am currently taking an Advanced SQL course.
